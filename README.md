# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This is the sixth assignment from the UConn Coding Bootcamp curriculum which combines our working knowledge of the first five week's topics ((Git, Terminal, HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, GitLab, Web Accessibility, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Web APIs and jQuery, Third-Party APIs.) with the sixth week's topic: Server-Side APIs. 

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

For this assignment we were asked to build a weather dashboard from scratch. 

## Goals
- Build a weather dashboard
- The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
- Will utilize [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.
    - Refer to the above site's documentation that includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. 
- Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.


#### Definitions

*Server-side APIs* :


## Instructions

Our instructions for this assignment were based on the following user story and acceptance criteria:

### User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```

## Developer

For my weather dashboard I focused on a simplified html format.Unlike the previous assignment, I have kept the html code clean so that the JavaScript code can populate it. 

## Mock-Up

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
